# Data
The data used to develop our Medium article came from: [INSERT DATA SOURCE](https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report). This data is sourced from the World Happiness Reports, which includes values for 153 countries from the years 2015 to 2020.

The data set contained the following columns:
* `Country name` - Name of the country.
* `Regional indicator` - Region of the country.
* `Ladder score` - The happiness score, or subjective well-being of the country. Taken from a  Gallup World Poll survey which asks people to rank their life from 0 to 10 with 10 being the best possible life and 0 being the worst possible life.
* `Logged GDP per capita` - Gross domestic product (purchasing power parity) per capita logged.
* `Social support` - Average of the binary responses(0 or 1) to the question "If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?".
* `Healthy life expectancy` - Life expectancy of healthy individuals taken from the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory.
* `Freedom to make life choices` - National average of responses to the question "Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?".
* `Generosity` - Residual of regressing national average of response to the question "Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?"
